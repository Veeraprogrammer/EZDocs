# EZDocs

Ez-Docs is a Google Docs clone that allows you to share and collaborate on documents at the same time!


This was all done within one week and has a good amount of features that Google Docs has, including sharing documents and live editing. Making all of this was fun and challenging at the same time! All of this was done using primarily  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Electron on the frontend, with Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB on the backend!

Below is a quick video outlining the features of my Google Docs clone called EZ-Docs!
